We aim to develop a dialog simulation framework, Socrates Sim, to support task completion dialog research. The goal of the framework is to provide a set of tools that will simulate the conversation between a user simulator and a dialog agent in order to generate large training data. Traditionally, dialog researchers would use human testers and annotators to generate quality labeled training data. However, this approach is very expensive and time consuming. The hope is that this framework will help researcher augment human generated test data with synthetic data, which would be generated from simulations with a user simulator. 

The Socrates Sim framework will provide a set of tools to define dialog domain, set up a user simulator, and run multiple simulations with a provided dialog agent. To demonstrate the flexibility and robustness of the framework to adapt to new domains, we will implement end-to-end simulations for the restaurant recommendation and move booking use case. The framework will be implemented in Python and made available on github at https://github.com/dhairyadalal/socrates.
