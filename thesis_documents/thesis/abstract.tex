In this thesis, we propose an end-to-end dialog simulation framework, called Socrates Sim, to support task completion dialog research. The goal of the framework is to provide a set of tools that will simulate conversations between a user simulator and a dialog agent in order evaluate the performance of the dialog agent and generate annotated data. Specifically, the Socrates Sim framework will allow the researcher to define the custom dialog domain, build user simulators, and run multiple simulations with a provided dialog agent. To demonstrate the flexibility of the framework to generalize to new domains, we will implement end-to-end simulations for the restaurant recommendation and move booking use case. The framework will be implemented in Python and made available on github (https://github.com/dhairyadalal/socrates).
