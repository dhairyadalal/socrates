information about human development, physiology, medicine and
evolution. Here we report the results of an international
collaboration to produce and make freely available a draft sequence of
the human genome. We also present an initial analysis of the data,
describing some of the insights that can be gleaned from the

@article{venter01,
    abstract = {A 2.91-billion base pair (bp) consensus sequence of
the euchromatic portion of the human genome was generated by the
whole-genome shotgun sequencing method. The 14.8-billion bp DNA
sequence was generated over 9 months from 27,271,853 high-quality
sequence reads (5.11-fold coverage of the genome) from both ends of
plasmid clones made from the DNA of five individuals. Two assembly
strategies-a whole-genome assembly and a regional chromosome
assembly-were used, each combining sequence data from Celera and the
publicly funded genome effort. The public data were shredded into
550-bp segments to create a 2.9-fold coverage of those genome regions
that had been sequenced, without including biases inherent in the
cloning and assembly procedure used by the publicly funded group. This
brought the effective coverage in the assemblies to eightfold,
reducing the number and size of gaps in the final assembly over what
would be obtained with 5.11-fold coverage. The two assembly strategies
yielded very similar results that largely agree with independent
mapping data. The assemblies effectively cover the euchromatic regions
of the human chromosomes. More than 90\% of the genome is in scaffold
assemblies of 100,000 bp or more, and 25\% of the genome is in
scaffolds of 10 million bp or larger. Analysis of the genome sequence
revealed 26,588 protein-encoding transcripts for which there was
strong corroborating evidence and an additional approximately 12,000
computationally derived genes with mouse matches or other weak
supporting evidence. Although gene-dense clusters are obvious, almost
half the genes are dispersed in low G+C sequence separated by large
tracts of apparently noncoding sequence. Only 1.1\% of the genome is
spanned by exons, whereas 24\% is in introns, with 75\% of the genome
being intergenic DNA. Duplications of segmental blocks, ranging in
size up to chromosomal lengths, are abundant throughout the genome and
reveal a complex evolutionary history. Comparative genomic analysis
indicates vertebrate expansions of genes associated with neuronal
function, with tissue-specific developmental regulation, and with the
hemostasis and immune systems. DNA sequence comparisons between the
consensus sequence and publicly funded genome data provided locations
of 2.1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A random pair
of human haploid genomes differed at a rate of 1 bp per 1250 on
average, but there was marked heterogeneity in the level of
polymorphism across the genome. Less than 1\% of all SNPs resulted in
variation in proteins, but the task of determining which SNPs have
functional consequences remains an open challenge.},

The new edition covers Subversion 1.5 with a complete introduction and guided tour of its capabilities, along with best practice recommendations.<br /> <br /> <em>Version Control with Subversion</em> is useful for people from a wide variety of backgrounds, from those with no previous version control experience to experienced system administrators.<br /> <br /> Subversion is the perfect tool to track individual changes when several people collaborate on documentation or, particularly, software development projects. As a more powerful and flexible successor to the CVS revision control system, Subversion makes life so much simpler, allowing each team member to work separately and then merge source code changes into a single repository that keeps a record of each separate version.<br /> <br /> Inside the updated edition Version Control with Subversion, you'll find:  <ul> <li>An introduction to Subversion and basic concepts behind version control</li> <li>A guided tour of the capabilities and structure of Subversion 1.5</li> </li>Guidelines for installing and configuring Subversion to manage programming, documentation, or any other team-based project</li> <li>Detailed coverage of complex topics such as branching and repository administration</li> <li>Advanced features such as properties, externals, and access control</li> <li>A guide to best practices</li> <li>Complete Subversion reference and troubleshooting guide</li> </ul> If you've never used version control, you'll find everything you need to get started. And if you're a seasoned CVS pro, this book will help you make a painless leap into Subversion.}},
