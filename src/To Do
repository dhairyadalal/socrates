Simulator Goals
1. Simple run
 X   a. run one simulation until max turns reached or dialog complete
    b. score dialog
    c. print dialog

2. Run multiple dialogs
    a. return agent score
    b. replay any n dialog or filtered set


3. Update kb lookup for Restaurant Agent


advanced
User simulator complication
    a. allow user to change mind with probablity p
    b. allow for goal corruption
    c. allow user to randomly exit conversation

Template:
    allow for negate with pref updates

NLG and NLU
    a. Seqtoseq NLG and NLU w/ Keras

DQN

Experiments

Annotated Data

Metrics
    a. optimal max turns
    b. average success rate

Experiments
    - compare multiple dialog agents against user simulator

Training Data
    - generate training data for annotated dialog
    - generate training data for nlg / nlu
